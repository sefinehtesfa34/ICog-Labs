<h1 style="color:orange;">Types of the Systems</h1>
There are many ways and complex algorithms used to build a recommender system. The following are fundamental approaches. While reading, the reader should think which one may be the most effective method when it comes to a movie recommendation.

# The Most Popular Item: 
It is the simplest strategy and requires no coding skills. It works based on the assumption that the most popular item attracts most consumers or most users. For example, any consumer shopping on Amazon would see the most frequently bought items. Conversely, Netflix would recommend every user the most popular movie in its list.

Association & Market Based Model: The system makes recommendations based on the items in the consumer's basket. For instance, if the system detected that the buyer is purchasing ground coffee it would also suggest her to buy filters as well (observed association coffee - filters).

# Content Filtering: 
Uses metadata to determine the user's taste. For example, the system recommends the user movies based on their preferences of genres, actors, themes, etc. Such a system matches the user and the item based on similarity. For example, if the user watched and liked Terminator and Predator (both action movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the main role), it would probably recommend them to watch Commando.

# Collaborative Filtering (CF): 
It is an algorithmic architecture that recommends consumers items based on their observed behavior. There are two types of Collaborative Filtering frameworks: Model-Based Approach and Memory-Based Approach:

# User-based (UBCF): 
It is a predecessor of Item-based CF. UBCF makes recommendations based on the user's characteristics that are similar to other users in the system. For example, if the end-user positively rates a movie, the algorithm finds other users who have previously rated the movie too, i.e. these users are similar to one another. In the next step, the system recommends the user an unseen movie but highly rated by other - referenced - users. See Figure 1.
# Item-based (IBCF): 
IBCF was originally developed by Amazon and is currently adopted by most online corporations (e.g. Netflix, YouTube, etc.).

# Hybrid Models: 
As the name suggests, the Hybrid Models combine two or more recommendation strategies. For instance, a Hybrid Content-Collaborative System can recommend the user a movie based on their gender but still focuses on the movie features the user exhibits to prefer.
##### With the ever-growing volume of online information, recommender systems have been an effective strategy to overcome such information overload. The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice.
